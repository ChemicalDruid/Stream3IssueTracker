# UnicornAttractor Issue Tracker

Stream 3 project for Code Institute course 

## About
A user-driven Django-powered website using technologies that I have learned throughout Streams 1, 2 and 3 of my Code Institute course on full-stack development.

I pretend to develop the fictional UnicornAttractor app. As part of my development process, I allow the free use of my app, provifing free-of-charge bug fixing support, while asking for payment in order to implement suggested features.

The vast majority of the code base is taken from my Stream 3 work on the we_are_social app, available as a repository in my GitHub page.

## Technologies
**[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)** - Open-source framework for Python applications.

**[flatpages](#)** is an optional Django app allowing for simple, "flat" HTML content stored in a database and managed via Django's admin interface. 

**[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)** provides a responsive framework to the application. This was enhanced with media queries and additional code to resize some of the dc.js charts, which are not natively responsive.

**[jquery](https://jquery.com/)** - cross-platform JavaScript library designed to simplify the client-side scripting of HTML.

**[Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.com/)** - font and icon toolkit based on CSS and LESS.

**[TinyMCE](http://www.tinymce.com/)** - browser-based JavaScript-powered WYSIWYG editor control 

**[WhiteNoise](http://whitenoise.evans.io/en/stable/)** allows your web app to serve its own static files. 

**[MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/)** - open-source RDBMS used for storing model data in Django apps
